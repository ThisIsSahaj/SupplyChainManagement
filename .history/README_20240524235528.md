# Blockchain Supply Chain Management DApp



Blockchain Supply chain management plays a critical role in ensuring efficient operations and maintaining consumer trust. This project focuses on developing and deploying a decentralized application (DApp) powered by blockchain technology to streamline supply chain management processes.

Our DApp utilizes the inherent transparency and immutability of blockchain to provide a secure and transparent platform for tracking goods at every stage of the supply chain. Leveraging smart contracts, the DApp automates various tasks such as verifying product authenticity, recording transactions, and managing inventory in real-time
